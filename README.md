WebStorage Service for AngularJS
================================

The webStorage service has both a generic and direct API. The generic API will check for client support and preferred order before altering a specific storage value, trying to degrade gracefully according to a set heuristic. The direct APIs works with either the client's local, session or the module's own in-memory storage engines.

The selection heuristics for the generic API is mainly dictated by the order specified in the module constant `order` (defaults to `['local', 'session', 'memory']`.) If the client has no support for the specified storage engine then the service will try to fall back on the next specified engine and so forth.

NOTE: The in-memory storage should really be seen as a last resort since all its values will be lost on page reload (somewhat negating the whole idea of client web storage!)

If the client doesn't support local or session web storage the module will try to mimic them by setting cookies on the current document.

All errors will be broadcast via the $rootScope under the name specified in the module constant `errorName` (defaults to: `webStorage.notification.error`.)

The service provides the following generic methods:

`webStorage`
* `isSupported`     -- boolean flag indicating client support status (local or session storage)
* `add(key, value)` -- add a value to storage under the specific key (storage according to 'order')
* `get(key)`        -- return the specified value (storage according to 'order')
* `remove(key)`     -- remove a key/value pair from storage (storage according to 'order')
* `clear()`         -- remove all key/value pairs from storage (storage according to 'order')
* `removeFromAll(key)`     -- remove a key/value pair from all storage engines
* `clearFromAll()`         -- remove all key/value pairs from all storage engines


It also provides the following direct APIs:

`webStorage.local`
* `isSupported`     -- boolean flag indicating client support status (local storage)
* `add(key, value)` -- add a value to storage under the specific key (local storage)
* `get(key)`        -- return the specified value (local storage)
* `remove(key)`     -- remove a key/value pair from storage (local storage)
* `clear()`         -- remove all key/value pairs from storage (local storage)

`webStorage.session`
* `isSupported`     -- boolean flag indicating client support status (session storage)
* `add(key, value)` -- add a value to storage under the specific key (session storage)
* `get(key)`        -- return the specified value (session storage)
* `remove(key)`     -- remove a key/value pair from storage (session storage)
* `clear()`         -- remove all key/value pairs from storage (session storage)

`webStorage.memory`
* `isSupported`     -- boolean true, the in-memory storage is always supported
* `add(key, value)` -- add a value to storage under the specific key (in-memory storage)
* `get(key)`        -- return the specified value (in-memory storage)
* `remove(key)`     -- remove a key/value pair from storage (in-memory storage)
* `clear()`         -- remove all key/value pairs from storage (in-memory storage)

## Module Version
0.9.4

## Requirements
This module was built for AngularJS v1.0.5.

## Usage
Add `webStorageModule` to your app's dependencies. Then inject `webStorage` into any controller that needs to use it, e.g.:

    var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['webStorageModule']);
    myApp.controller('myController', function ($scope, webStorage) { ... });
